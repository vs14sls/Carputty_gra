# Car Maintenance Cost Prediction Model
This prediction model forecasts the car monthly maintenance costs. It includes the factors that severely affect car performance and raises maintenance demands toward ensuring vehicle reliability and optimum performance. It direclty helps Customers to know what their car was worth of, what itâ€™s worth now and what it will be after 60 months. Their decision will be dependent on the machine learning methods.

1. Bucketing the cars according to their body types and aligning the values to our dataset so that we can have a comprehensive model.
2. Miles driven also plays a major role in calculating the maintenance cost, most of the cars have similar sets of routine maintenance to be done whenever the miles are reached.
